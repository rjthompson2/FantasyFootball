# FantasyFootball
I first started watching football and playing Fantasy Football during the 2020 season. I was roommates with 11 other guys in an apartment in SF and needed to play so they could have enough people. It was a $20 dollar buy-in, now up to $100, with a pay structure of 3rd getting their money back, 2nd making some profit and the rest going to 1st place. They also decided to create a punishment for last place and agreed that the 1st place winnings would help pay for any punishment.

I got last place that season...
They cut my hair to look like a monk.

That slight will not go unpunished.

So I decided to make an algorithm to win. I needed something to guide me when picking players during the draft, who to start/sit, and who to trade. The next season (2021) I got third place, but was in first until the finals. My system won me great trades such as getting Johnathan Taylor for Ezekiel Elliot week 3. While I did not win first, this showed improvement and encouraged me to keep working on it.
